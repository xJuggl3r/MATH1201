## 2.1 The Rectangular Coordinate Systems and Graphs

> Learning Objectives
> In this section you will:
>+	 Plot ordered pairs in a Cartesian coordinate system.

>+	 Find x-intercepts and y-intercepts.
>+	 Use the distance formula.
>+	 Use the midpoint formula.

The Cartesian coordinate system, also called the rectangular coordinate system, is based on a two-dimensional plane consisting of the x-axis and the y-axis. Perpendicular to each other, the axes divide the plane into four sections. Each section is called a **quadrant**; the quadrants are numbered counterclockwise.

The center of the plane is the point at which the two axes cross. It is known as the **origin, or point (0, 0)**. From the origin, each axis is further divided into equal units: increasing, positive numbers to the right on the **x-axis** and up the **y-axis**; decreasing, negative numbers to the left on the x-axis and down the y-axis. The axes extend to positive and negative infinity.

Each point in the plane is identified by its **x-coordinate**, or horizontal displacement from the origin, and its **y-coordinate**, or vertical displacement from the origin. Together, we write them as an **ordered pair** indicating the combined distance from the origin in the form (x, y).

>A point in the plane is defined as an ordered pair, (x,y), such that x is determined by its horizontal distance from the origin and y is determined by its vertical distance from the origin.

## Graphing Equations by Plotting Points
We can plot a set of points to represent an equation. When such an equation contains both an $x$ variable and a $y$ variable, it is called an **equation in two variables**. Its graph is called a **graph in two variables**. Any graph on a twodimensional plane is a graph in two variables.

Suppose we want to graph the equation $y = 2x − 1$. We can begin by substituting a value for $x$ into the equation and
determining the resulting value of $y$. Each pair of x- and y-values is an ordered pair that can be plotted.

We can plot the points in the table. The points for this particular equation form a line, so we can connect them.

> ### How To…
>
>Given an equation, graph by plotting points.
>1. Make a table with one column labeled x, a second column labeled with the equation, and a third column listing the resulting ordered pairs.
>2. Enter x-values down the first column using positive and negative values. Selecting the x-values in numerical order will make the graphing simpler.
>3. Select x-values that will yield y-values with little effort, preferably ones that can be calculated mentally.
>4. Plot the ordered pairs.
>5. Connect the points if they form a line.

## Finding x-intercepts and y-intercepts
The intercepts of a graph are points at which the graph crosses the axes. The **x-intercept** *is the point at which the graph crosses the x-axis*. At this point, the y-coordinate is zero. The **y-intercept** *is the point at which the graph crosses the y-axis*. At this point, the x-coordinate is zero.
To determine the x-intercept, we set y equal to zero and solve for x. Similarly, to determine the y-intercept, we set x equal to zero and solve for y. 

>### Given an equation, find the intercepts.
>+	 Find the x-intercept by setting y = 0 and solving for x.
>+	 Find the y-intercept by setting x = 0 and solving for y.

## Using the Distance Formula
Derived from the Pythagorean Theorem, the **distance formula** is used to find the distance between two points in the plane. The Pythagorean Theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, is based on a right triangle where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs adjacent to the right angle, and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.

 To find the length c, take the square root of both sides of the Pythagorean Theorem. $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 → c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

 It follows that the distance formula is given as

 $\large\ d^2 = (x_2 − x_1)^2 + (y_2 − y_1)^2 → d = \sqrt{(x_2 − x_1)^2 + (y_2 − y_1)^2}$
 
 >### The distance formula
> Given endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the distance between two points is given by
>
>$\LARGE\ d = \sqrt{(x_2 − x_1)^2 + (y_2 − y_1)^2}$

## Using the Midpoint Formula
When the endpoints of a line segment are known, we can find the point midway between them. This point is known as the midpoint and the formula is known as the midpoint formula. Given the endpoints of a line segment, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the midpoint formula states how to find the coordinates of the midpoint M.

$\LARGE\ M = (\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$

# 2.2 Linear Equations in One Variable

> ### Learning Objectives

>In this section you will:
>+	 Solve equations in one variable algebraically.
>+	 Solve a rational equation.
>+	 Find a linear equation.
>+	 Given the equations of two lines, determine whether their graphs are parallel or perpendicular.
>+	 Write the equation of a line parallel or perpendicular to a given line.

## Solving Linear Equations in One Variable
A **linear equation** is an equation of a straight line, written in one variable. The only power of the variable is 1. Linear equations in one variable may take the form $ax + b = 0$ and are solved using basic algebraic operations.

We begin by classifying linear equations in one variable as one of three types: identity, conditional, or inconsistent.

An **identity equation** is true for all values of the variable. Here is an example of an identity equation.

$\large\ 3x = 2x + x$

The **solution set** consists of all values that make the equation true. For this equation, the solution set is all real numbers because any real number substituted for x will make the equation true.

A **conditional equation** is true for only some values of the variable. For example, if we are to solve the equation
$5x + 2 = 3x − 6$, we have the following:

$5x + 2 = 3x − 6$

$2x = −8$

$x = −4$

The solution set consists of one number: {−4}. It is the only solution and, therefore, we have solved a conditional
equation.

An **inconsistent equation** results in a false statement. For example, if we are to solve $5x − 15 = 5(x − 4)$, we have the following:

$5x − 15 = 5x − 20$

$5x − 15 − 5x = 5x − 20 − 5x$ Subtract 5x from both sides.

$−15 ≠ −20$ False statement

Indeed, $−15 ≠ −20$. There is no solution because this is an inconsistent equation.
Solving linear equations in one variable involves the fundamental properties of equality and basic algebraic operations.


> ### linear equation in one variable
>A linear equation in one variable can be written in the form $ax + b = 0$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, $a ≠ 0$.

> ### How To…
>
>Given a linear equation in one variable, use algebra to solve it.
>
>The following steps are used to manipulate an equation and isolate the unknown variable, so that the last line reads $x =$ , if $x$ is the unknown. There is no set order, as the steps used depend on what is given:
>1. We may add, subtract, multiply, or divide an equation by a number or an expression as long as we do the same thing to both sides of the equal sign. Note that we cannot divide by zero.
>2. Apply the distributive property as needed: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$.
>3. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation.
>4. When the variable is multiplied by a coefficient in the final stage, multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient

## Solving a Rational Equation
In this section, we look at rational equations that, after some manipulation, result in a linear equation. If an equation contains at least one rational expression, it is a considered a rational equation.

Rational equations have a variable in the denominator in at least one of the terms. Our goal is to perform algebraic operations so that the variables appear in the numerator. In fact, we will eliminate all denominators by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD).

Finding the LCD is identifying an expression that contains the highest power of all of the factors in all of the denominators. We do this because when the equation is multiplied by the LCD, the common factors in the LCD and in each denominator will equal one and will cancel out.

>### Rational equations

> ### How To…

>1. Factor all denominators in the equation.
>2. Find and exclude values that set each denominator equal to zero.
>3. Find the LCD.
>4. Multiply the whole equation by the LCD. If the LCD is correct, there will be no denominators left.
>5. Solve the remaining equation.
>6. Make sure to check solutions back in the original equations to avoid a solution producing zero in a denominator.


## Finding a Linear Equation
Perhaps the most familiar form of a _linear equation_ is the **slope-intercept form**, written as $\large\ y = mx + b$, where $m = slope$ and $b = y-intercept$. Let us begin with the slope.

### The Slope of a Line
The slope of a line refers to the ratio of the vertical change in y over the horizontal change in x between any two points on a line. It indicates the direction in which a line slants as well as its steepness. Slope is sometimes described as rise over run.

$\LARGE\ m = \frac{y_2 - y1}{x_2 - x_1}$

If the slope is positive, the line slants to the right. If the slope is negative, the line slants to the left. As the slope increases, the line becomes steeper.

### The Point-Slope Formula
Given the slope and one point on a line, we can find the equation of the line using the point-slope formula.

$\LARGE\ y − y1 = m(x − x1)$

*This is an important formula*, as it *will be used in other areas of college algebra and often in calculus* to find the equation of a tangent line. We need only one point and the slope of the line to use the formula. After substituting the slope and the coordinates of one point into the formula, we simplify it and write it in slope-intercept form.

### Standard Form of a Line
Another way that we can represent the equation of a line is in standard form. Standard form is given as

$Ax + By = C$

where A, B, and C are integers. The x- and y-terms are on one side of the equal sign and the constant term is on the
other side.

### Vertical and Horizontal Lines
The equations of vertical and horizontal lines do not require any of the preceding formulas, although we can use the formulas to prove that the equations are correct. The equation of a vertical line is given as

$\LARGE\ x = c$

where c is a constant. The slope of a vertical line is undefined, and regardless of the y-value of any point on the line, the x-coordinate of the point will be c.

The equation of a horizontal line is given as

$\LARGE\ y = c$

where c is a constant. The slope of a horizontal line is zero, and for any x-value of a point on the line, the y-coordinate will be c.

### Determining Whether Graphs of Lines are Parallel or Perpendicular
Parallel lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts. Lines that are parallel to each other will never intersect.

All of the lines shown in the graph are parallel because they have the same slope and different y-intercepts.
Lines that are perpendicular intersect to form a 90°-angle. The slope of one line is the negative reciprocal of the other. 

We can show that two lines are perpendicular if the product of the two slopes is −1: m1 ⋅ m2 = −1.

## Writing the Equations of Lines Parallel or Perpendicular to a Given Line
As we have learned, determining whether two lines are parallel or perpendicular is a matter of finding the slopes. To write the equation of a line parallel or perpendicular to another line, we follow the same principles as we do for finding the equation of any line. After finding the slope, use the point-slope formula to write the equation of the new line.


>### How To…
>
>Given an equation for a line, write the equation of a line parallel or perpendicular to it.
>1. Find the slope of the given line. The easiest way to do this is to write the equation in slope-intercept form.
>2. Use the slope and the given point with the point-slope formula.
>3. Simplify the line to slope-intercept form and compare the equation to the given line.

>+	 Use a formula to solve a real-world application.

### Setting up a Linear Equation to Solve a Real-World Application
To set up or model a linear equation to fit a real-world application, we must first determine the known quantities and define the unknown quantity as a variable. Then, we begin to interpret the words as mathematical expressions using mathematical symbols.

When dealing with real-world applications, there are certain expressions that we can translate directly into math.
Table 1 lists some common verbal expressions and their equivalent mathematical expressions.

|Verbal|Translation to Math Operations|
|---|:---:|
|One number exceeds another by $a$|$\large\ x, x + a$|
|Twice a number|$\large\ 2x$|
|One number is $a$ more than another number|$\large\ x, x + a$|
|One number is $a$ less than twice another number|$\large\ x, 2x − a$|
|The product of a number and $a$, decreased by $b$|$ax − b$|
|The quotient of a number and the number plus $a$ is three times the number| $\large\frac{x}{x + a}= 3x$|
|The product of three times a number and the number decreased by $b$ is $c$|$\large\ 3x(x − b) = c$|

>### How To…
> Given a real-world problem, model a linear equation to fit it.
>1. Identify known quantities.
>2. Assign a variable to represent the unknown quantity.
>3. If there is more than one unknown quantity, find a way to write the second unknown in terms of the first.
>4. Write an equation interpreting the words as mathematical operations.
>5. Solve the equation. Be sure the solution can be explained in words, including the units of measure.


## Using a Formula to Solve a Real-World Application
Many applications are solved using known formulas. The problem is stated, a formula is identified, the known quantities are substituted into the formula, the equation is solved for the unknown, and the problem’s question is answered. Typically, these problems involve two equations representing two trips, two investments, two areas, and so on. Examples of formulas include the area of a rectangular region, $A = LW$; the perimeter of a rectangle, $P = 2L + 2W$; and the volume of a rectangular solid, $V = LWH$. When there are two unknowns, we find a way to write one in terms of the other because we can solve for only one variable at a time.

# 2.4 Complex Numbers
>### Learning Objectives
>In this section you will:
>+	 Add and subtract complex numbers.
>+	 Multiply and divide complex numbers.
>+	 Solve quadratic equations with complex numbers


## Expressing Square Roots of Negative Numbers as Multiples of i
We know how to find the square root of any positive real number. In a similar way, we can find the square root of any negative number. The difference is that the root is not real. If the value in the radicand is negative, the root is said to be an imaginary number. **The imaginary number $i$ is defined as the square root of −1**.

$\large \sqrt{-1} = i$

So, using properties of radicals,

$\large\ i^2 = (\sqrt{-1})^2 = -1$

We can write the square root of any negative number as a multiple of i. Consider the square root of −49.

$\large\ \sqrt{-49} = \sqrt{49 \times (-1)}$

$\large\ =\sqrt{49} \sqrt{-1}$

$\large\ =7i$

We use $7i$ and not $−7i$ because the principal root of 49 is the positive root.

A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number. A complex number is expressed in standard form when written $a + bi$ where $a$ is the real part and $b$ is the imaginary part. 

>### Imaginary and complex numbers
>A **complex number** is a number of the form $a + bi$ where
>+	 $a$ is the real part of the complex number.
>+	 $b$ is the imaginary part of the complex number.
>
>If $b = 0$, then $a + bi$ is a real number. If $a = 0$ and $b$ is not equal to $0$, the complex number is called a pure imaginary number. An **imaginary number** is an even root of a negative number.

>### How To…
>Given an imaginary number, express it in the standard form of a complex number.
>1. Write $\large\ =\sqrt{-a}$ as $\large\ =\sqrt{a} \sqrt{-1}$.
>2. Express $\large\ =\sqrt{-1}$ as $\large\ i$.
>3. Write $\large\ =\sqrt{a}\times i$ in simplest form.

## Plotting a Complex Number on the Complex Plane
We cannot plot complex numbers on a number line as we might real numbers. However, we can still represent them graphically. To represent a complex number, we need to address the two components of the number. We use the **complex plane**, which is a coordinate system in which the *horizontal axis represents the real component* and the *vertical axis represents the imaginary component*. Complex numbers are the points on the plane, expressed as ordered pairs $(a, b)$, where $a$ represents the coordinate for the horizontal axis and $b$ represents the coordinate for the vertical axis.

>### How To…
> Given a complex number, represent its components on the complex plane.
> 1. Determine the real part and the imaginary part of the complex number.
> 2. Move along the horizontal axis to show the real part of the number.
> 3. Move parallel to the vertical axis to show the imaginary part of the number.
> 4. Plot the point.

## Adding and Subtracting Complex Numbers
Just as with real numbers, we can perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers. To add or subtract complex numbers, we combine the real parts and then combine the imaginary parts.

>### Complex numbers: addition and subtraction
>Adding complex numbers:
>
>$\large\ (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i$
>
>Subtracting complex numbers:
>
>$\large (a + bi) − (c + di) = (a − c) + (b − d)i$

>### How To…
> Given two complex numbers, find the sum or difference.
> 1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each number.
> 2. Add or subtract the real parts.
> 3. Add or subtract the imaginary parts.

## Multiplying Complex Numbers
Multiplying complex numbers is much like multiplying binomials. The major difference is that we work with the real and imaginary parts separately.

### Multiplying a Complex Number by a Real Number
Lets begin by multiplying a complex number by a real number. We distribute the real number just as we would with
a binomial.

>### How To…
>Given a complex number and a real number, multiply to find the product.
>1. Use the distributive property.
>2. Simplify.

### Multiplying Complex Numbers Together
Now, let’s multiply two complex numbers. We can use either the distributive property or more specifically the FOIL method because we are dealing with binomials. Recall that FOIL is an acronym for multiplying First, Inner, Outer, and Last terms together. The difference with complex numbers is that when we get a squared term, $i^2$, it equals $−1$.

>### How To…
> Given two complex numbers, multiply to find the product.
>1. Use the distributive property or the FOIL method.
>2. Remember that $i^2 = −1$.
>3. Group together the real terms and the imaginary terms

## Dividing Complex Numbers
Dividing two complex numbers is more complicated than adding, subtracting, or multiplying because we cannot divide by an imaginary number, meaning that any fraction must have a real-number denominator to write the answer in standard form $a + bi$. We need to find a term by which we can multiply the numerator and the denominator that will eliminate the imaginary portion of the denominator so that we end up with a real number as the denominator.
This term is called **the complex conjugate of the denominator**, which is *found by changing the sign of the imaginary part of the complex number*. In other words, the complex conjugate of $a + bi$ is $a − bi$. For example, the product of $a + bi$ and $a − bi$ is 

$\large\ (a + bi)(a − bi) = a^2 − abi + abi − b^2i^2$

$\large\ = a^2 + b$

The result is a real number.

>### The complex conjugate
>The complex conjugate of a complex number $a + bi$ is $a − bi$. It is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part of the complex number. The real part of the number is left unchanged.
>+	 When a complex number is multiplied by its complex conjugate, the result is a real number.
>+	 When a complex number is added to its complex conjugate, the result is a real number.

>### How To…
>Given two complex numbers, divide one by the other.
>1. Write the division problem as a fraction.
>2. Determine the complex conjugate of the denominator.
>3. Multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the complex conjugate of the denominator.
>4. Simplify

### Simplifying Powers of i
The powers of i are cyclic. Let’s look at what happens when we raise $i$ to increasing powers.

The cycle is repeated continuously: $\large\ i, −1, − i, 1$, *every four powers*.

# 2.5 Quadratic Equations

>### Learning Objectives
>In this section you will:
>+	 Solve quadratic equations by factoring.
>+	 Solve quadratic equations by the square root property.
>+	 Solve quadratic equations by completing the square.
>+	 Solve quadratic equations by using the quadratic formula

## Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring
An equation containing a second-degree polynomial is called a quadratic equation. For example, equations such as $2x^2 + 3x − 1 = 0$ and $x^2 − 4 = 0$ are quadratic equations. They are used in countless ways in the fields of engineering, architecture, finance, biological science, and, of course, mathematics.

**Often the easiest method of solving a quadratic equation is factoring. *Factoring* means *finding expressions that can
be multiplied together* to give the expression on one side of the equation.**

If a quadratic equation can be factored, it is written as a product of linear terms. Solving by factoring depends on the
zero-product property, which states that if f the product of two numbers or two expressions equals zero, then one of the numbers or one of the expressions must equal zero because zero multiplied by anything equals zero.

Multiplying the factors expands the equation to a string of terms separated by plus or minus signs. So, in that sense, the operation of multiplication undoes the operation of factoring. For example, expand the factored expression $(x − 2)(x + 3)$ by multiplying the two factors together.

$\large\ (x − 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 3x − 2x − 6$

$\large\ = x^2 + x − 6$

*The product is a quadratic expression*. **Set equal to zero, $x^2 + x − 6 = 0$ is a quadratic equation**. If we were to factor the equation, we would get back the factors we multiplied.

We can use the zero-product property to solve quadratic equations in which we first have to factor out the greatest common factor (GCF), and for equations that have special factoring formulas as well, such as the difference of squares, both of which we will see later in this section.

>### The zero-product property and quadratic equations
>The zero-product property states
>
>If $a ⋅ b = 0$, then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$, where a and b are real numbers or algebraic expressions.
>
>A quadratic equation is an equation containing a second-degree polynomial; for example $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers, and if $a ≠ 0$, it is in standard form.

>### How To…
>Given a quadratic equation with the leading coefficient of 1, factor it.
>1. Find two numbers whose product equals c and whose sum equals b.
>2. Use those numbers to write two factors of the form $(x + k)$ or $(x − k)$, where $k$ is one of the numbers found in step 1. Use the numbers exactly as they are. In other words, if the two numbers are $1$ and $−2$, the factors are $(x + 1)(x − 2)$.
>3. Solve using the zero-product property by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for the variable.

### Completing the Square
Not all quadratic equations can be factored or can be solved in their original form using the square root property.
In these cases, we may use a method for solving a quadratic equation known as completing the square. Using this method, we add or subtract terms to both sides of the equation until we have a perfect square trinomial on one side of the equal sign. We then apply the square root property. To complete the square, the leading coefficient, a, must equal 1.
If it does not, then divide the entire equation by a. Then, we can use the following procedures to solve a quadratic equation by completing the square.

### Using the Quadratic Formula
The fourth method of solving a quadratic equation is by using the quadratic formula, a formula that will solve all quadratic equations. Although the quadratic formula works on any quadratic equation in standard form, it is easy to make errors in substituting the values into the formula. Pay close attention when substituting, and use parentheses when inserting a negative number.

>### The quadratic formula
>Written in standard form, ax2 + bx + c = 0, any quadratic equation can be solved using the quadratic formula:
>
>$\LARGE\ x = \frac{−b ± \sqrt{b^2 − 4ac}}{2a}$
>
>where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0

>### How To…
> Given a quadratic equation, solve it using the quadratic formula
>1. Make sure the equation is in standard form: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
>2. Make note of the values of the coefficients and constant term, $a$, $b$, and $c$.
>3. Carefully substitute the values noted in step 2 into the equation. To avoid needless errors, use parentheses around each number input into the formula.
>4. Calculate and solve.


### The Discriminant
The quadratic formula not only generates the solutions to a quadratic equation, it tells us about the nature of the solutions when we consider the discriminant, or the expression under the radical, $b^2 − 4ac$. The discriminant tells us whether the solutions are real numbers or complex numbers, and how many solutions of each type to expect.

|Value of Discriminant |Results|
|:---:|:---:|
|$b^2 − 4ac = 0$| One rational solution (double solution)|
|$b^2 − 4ac > 0$, perfect square|Two rational solutions|
|$b^2 − 4ac > 0$, not a perfect square|Two irrational solutions|
|$b^2 − 4ac < 0$|Two complex solutions|

# 2.6 Other Types of Equations

### Learning Objectives
>In this section you will:
>+	 Solve equations involving rational exponents.
>+	 Solve equations using factoring.
>+	 Solve radical equations.
>+	 Solve absolute value equations.
>+	 Solve other types of equations.

## 2.6 Other Types of Equation

We have solved linear equations, rational equations, and quadratic equations using several methods. However, there are many other types of equations, and we will investigate a few more types in this section. We will look at equations involving rational exponents, polynomial equations, radical equations, absolute value equations, equations in quadratic form, and some rational equations that can be transformed into quadratics. Solving any equation, however, employs the same basic algebraic rules. We will learn some new techniques as they apply to certain equations, but the algebra never changes.

### Solving Equations Involving Rational Exponents
Rational exponents are exponents that are fractions, where the numerator is a power and the denominator is a root.

We can solve equations in which a variable is raised to a rational exponent by raising both sides of the equation to the reciprocal of the exponent. The reason we raise the equation to the reciprocal of the exponent is because we want to eliminate the exponent on the variable term, and a number multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1. 

>### Rational exponents
A rational exponent indicates a power in the numerator and a root in the denominator. There are multiple ways of writing an expression, a variable, or a number with a rational exponent:

$\large a^\frac{m}{n} = (a^\frac{1}{n})^m = (a^m)^\frac{1}{n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m$

### Solving Equations Using Factoring
We have used factoring to solve quadratic equations, but it is a technique that we can use with many types of polynomial equations, which are equations that contain a string of terms including numerical coefficients and variables. When we are faced with an equation containing polynomials of degree higher than 2, we can often solve them by factoring.

>### Polynomial equations
>A polynomial of degree n is an expression of the type
>
>$$\large\ a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0 $$
>
>where n is a positive integer and $a_n , … , a_0$ are real numbers and an ≠ 0.
>Setting the polynomial equal to zero gives a **polynomial equation**. The total number of solutions (real and complex) to a polynomial equation is equal to the highest exponent $n$.

### Solving Radical Equations

**Radical equations** are equations that contain variables in the radicand (the expression under a radical symbol), such as

$\large \sqrt{3x + 18} = x$

$\large \sqrt{x+3} = x-3$

$\large \sqrt{x + 5} - \sqrt{x - 3} = 2$

Radical equations may have one or more radical terms, and are solved by eliminating each radical, one at a time. 

>### How To…
> Given a radical equation, solve it.
>1. Isolate the radical expression on one side of the equal sign. Put all remaining terms on the other side.
>2. If the radical is a square root, then square both sides of the equation. If it is a cube root, then raise both sides of the equation to the third power. In other words, for an nth root radical, raise both sides to the nth power. Doing so eliminates the radical symbol.
>3. Solve the remaining equation.
>4. If a radical term still remains, repeat steps 1–2.
>5. Confirm solutions by substituting them into the original equation


### Solving an Absolute Value Equation
Next, we will learn how to solve an absolute value equation. To solve an equation such as |2x − 6| = 8, we notice that the absolute value will be equal to 8 if the quantity inside the absolute value bars is 8 or −8. This leads to two different equations we can solve independently.

Knowing how to solve problems involving absolute value functions is useful. For example, we may need to identify numbers or points on a line that are at a specified distance from a given reference point.


> ###Absolute value equations
>
>The absolute value of x is written as |x|. It has the following properties:
>
>If x ≥ 0, then |x| = x.
>
>If x < 0, then |x| = −x.
>

## Solving Other Types of Equations
There are many other types of equations in addition to the ones we have discussed so far. We will see more of them throughout the text. Here, we will discuss equations that are in quadratic form, and rational equations that result in a quadratic.

### Solving Equations in Quadratic Form
Equations in quadratic form are equations with three terms. The first term has a power other than 2. The middle term has an exponent that is one-half the exponent of the leading term. The third term is a constant. 

If the exponent on the middle term is one-half of the exponent on the leading term, we have an **equation in quadratic form**, which we can solve as if it were a quadratic. We substitute a variable for the middle term to solve equations in quadratic form.

## Using Interval Notation
Indicating the solution to an inequality such as x ≥ 4 can be achieved in several ways

We can use set-builder notation: {x|x ≥ 4}, which translates to “all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to 4.” Notice that braces are used to indicate a set.

The third method is **interval notation**, in which solution sets are indicated with parentheses or brackets. The solutions to x ≥ 4 are represented as [4, ∞).

The main concept to remember is that **parentheses represent solutions greater or less than the number**, and ***brackets represent solutions that are greater than or equal to or less than or equal to the number***. Use parentheses to represent infinity or negative infinity, since positive and negative infinity are not numbers in the usual sense of the word and, therefore, cannot be “equaled.”
