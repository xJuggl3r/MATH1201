### Classifying a Real Number

The *numbers we use for counting, or enumerating items*, are the **natural numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

The set of **whole numbers** is the *set of natural numbers plus zero*: {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.

The set of **integers** adds the *opposites of the natural numbers to the set of whole numbers*: {. . ., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.
    It is useful to note that the set of integers is made up of three distinct subsets: negative integers, zero, and positive integers.

The set of **rational numbers** is written as  $\Bigg\{$ $\frac{m}{n}$$\lvert$$m$ and $n$  are integers and $n$ ≠ 0 $\Bigg\}$

    Rational numbers are fractions (or quotients) containing integers in both the numerator and the denominator, and the denominator is never 0.
    We can also see that every natural number, whole number, and integer is a rational number with a denominator of 1.

Because they are fractions, any rational number can also be expressed in decimal form.

    Any rational number can be represented as either:
1. a terminating decimal: $\frac{15}{8}$ = 1.875, or
2. a repeating decimal: $\frac{4}{11}$ = 0.36363636 … = 0.$\overline{36}$

## Irrational Numbers

 **Irrational numbers** *cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers*. It is impossible to describe this set of numbers by a single rule except to say that a number is irrational if it is not rational. So we write this as shown.

{h| h is not a rational number $\mathbb{R}$}


The ***sets of rational* and *irrational numbers* together** make up the **set of real numbers**.

The real numbers can be visualized on a horizontal number line with an arbitrary point chosen as 0, with negative numbers to the left of 0 and positive numbers to the right of 0.

### Sets of Numbers as Subsets
Beginning with the natural numbers, we have expanded each set to form a larger set, meaning that there is a subset relationship between the sets of numbers we have encountered so far.

### sets of numbers
The **set of natural numbers** includes the *numbers used for counting*: {1, 2, 3, ...}.

The **set of whole numbers** is the *set of natural numbers plus zero*: {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

The **set of integers** *adds the negative natural numbers to the set of whole numbers*: {..., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }.

The **set of rational numbers** includes *fractions written as* $\Big\{$ $\frac{m}{n}$$\lvert$$m$ and $n$  are integers and $n$ ≠ 0 $\Big\}$

The **set of irrational numbers** is the *set of numbers that are not rational, are nonrepeating, and are nonterminating*:

{h|h is not a rational number}.


## Performing Calculations Using the Order of Operations

$a^n  = a * a * a * a * ...$

In this notation, $a^n$  is read as the nth power of a, where **a** is called **the base** and **n** is called the **exponent**. 

A term in exponential notation may be part of a mathematical expression, which is a combination of numbers and operations.
For example, 24+6∙$\frac{2}{3}$-42 is a mathematical expression.

To evaluate a mathematical expression, we perform the various operations. We use **the order of operations**. This is a sequence of rules for evaluating such expressions.

> ## order of operations
> Operations in mathematical expressions must be evaluated in a systematic order, which can be simplified using the acronym PEMDAS:
>
> P(arentheses)
>
> E(xponents)
>
> M(ultiplication) and D(ivision)
>
> A(ddition) and S(ubtraction)

## Using Properties of Real Numbers

### Commutative Properties
The **commutative property of addition** states that numbers may be added in any order without affecting the sum.

$a + b = b + a$

Similarly, the **commutative property of multiplication** states that numbers may be multiplied in any order without
affecting the product.

$a * b = b * a$

It is important to note that neither subtraction nor division is commutative. For example, 17 − 5 is not the same as 5 − 17. Similarly, 20 ÷ 5 ≠ 5 ÷ 20.


### Associative Properties
The **associative property of multiplication** tells us that it does not matter how we group numbers when multiplying. We can move the grouping symbols to make the calculation easier, and the product remains the same.

$a(bc) = (ab)c$

The **associative property of addition** tells us that numbers may be grouped differently without affecting the sum.

$a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$

*Neither subtraction nor division is associative*.


### Distributive Property
The **distributive property** states that the product of a factor times a sum is the sum of the factor times each term in the sum.

$a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c$

### Identity Properties
The **identity property of addition** states that there is a unique number, called the additive identity (0) that, when added to a number, results in the original number.

$a + 0 = a$


The **identity property of multiplication** states that there is a unique number, called the multiplicative identity (1) that, when multiplied by a number, results in the original number.

$a * 1 = a$


### Inverse Properties
The **inverse property of addition** states that, for every real number $a$, there is a unique number, called the additive inverse (or opposite), denoted $−a$, that, when added to the original number, results in the additive identity, 0.
a + (−a) = 0

The **inverse property of multiplication** holds for all real numbers except 0 because the reciprocal of 0 is not defined.
The property states that, for every real number a, there is a unique number, called the multiplicative inverse (or reciprocal), denoted $\frac{1}{a}$, that, when multiplied by the original number, results in the multiplicative identity, $a*$ $\frac{1}{a}$=1


## Evaluating Algebraic Expressions

In the expression $x + 5$, **$5$ is called a constant** because it does not vary and **$x$ is called a variable** because it does. (In naming the variable, ignore any exponents or radicals containing the variable).
An *algebraic expression* is a *collection of constants and variables joined together by the algebraic operations* of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Any variable in an algebraic expression may take on or be assigned different values. When that happens, the value of the algebraic expression changes. To evaluate an algebraic expression means to determine the value of the expression for a given value of each variable in the expression.

Replace each variable in the expression with the given value, then simplify the resulting expression using the order of operations. If the algebraic expression contains more than one variable, replace each variable with its assigned value and simplify the expression as before.

## Formulas
An **equation** is a mathematical statement indicating that two expressions are equal. The expressions can be numerical or algebraic. The equation is not inherently true or false, but only a proposition. The values that make the equation true, the solutions, are found using the properties of real numbers and other results. For example, the equation 2x + 1 = 7 has the unique solution x = 3 because when we substitute 3 for x in the equation, we obtain the true statement 2(3) + 1 = 7.

A **formula** is an equation expressing a relationship between constant and variable quantities. Very often, the equation is a means of finding the value of one quantity (often a single variable) in terms of another or other quantities. One of the most common examples is the formula for finding the area A of a circle in terms of the radius r of the circle:
$A = πr^2$. For any value of r, the area A can be found by evaluating the expression $πr^2$.

### Simplifying Algebraic Expressions
Sometimes we can simplify an algebraic expression to make it easier to evaluate or to use in some other way. To do so, *we use the properties of real numbers*. We can use the same properties in formulas because they contain algebraic expressions.

## Section 1.2 - Exponents and Scientific Notation

> Learning Objectives
>
>In this section students will:
>
>+    Use the product rule of exponents.
>+	 Use the quotient rule of exponents.
>+	 Use the power rule of exponents.
>+	 Use the zero exponent rule of exponents.
>+	 Use the negative rule of exponents.

### Using the Product Rule of Exponents
Consider the product $x^3$ * $x^4$.Both terms have the same base, x, but they are raised to different exponents. Expand each expression, and then rewrite the resulting expression.

$x^3$ * $x^4$ $= x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x$ = $x^7$

Notice that the exponent of the product is the sum of the exponents of the terms. In other words, when multiplying exponential expressions with the same base, we write the result with the common base and add the exponents. This is the **product rule of exponents**.


$a^m$ $*$ $a^n$ $=$ $a^{m+n}$

We can always check that this is true by simplifying each exponential expression. We find that $2^3$ is 8, $2^4$ is 16, and $2^7$ is 128. The product $8*16$ equals 128, so the relationship is true. We can use the product rule of exponents to simplify expressions that are a product of two numbers or expressions with the same base but different exponents.


### Using the Quotient Rule of Exponents
The quotient rule of exponents allows us to simplify an expression that divides two numbers with the same base but different exponents. In a similar way to the product rule, we can simplify an expression such as $\frac{y^m}{y^n}$, where m > n. 

Notice that the exponent of the quotient is the difference between the exponents of the divisor and dividend.

$\frac{a^m}{a^n}$ $=a^{m − n}$

### Using the Power Rule of Exponents

Suppose an exponential expression is raised to some power. Can we simplify the result? Yes. To do this, we use the power rule of exponents. Consider the expression (${x^2})^3$. The expression inside the parentheses is multiplied twice because it has an exponent of 2. Then the result is multiplied three times because the entire expression has an exponent of 3.

The exponent of the answer is the product of the exponents: (${x^2})^3$ $=$ $x^{2*3}$ = $x^6$. In other words, when raising an exponential expression to a power, we write the result with the common base and the product of the exponents.

($a^m$)$^n$ $=$ $a^{m * n}$

### Using the Zero Exponent Rule of Exponents
Return to the quotient rule. We made the condition that $m > n$ so that the difference m − n would never be zero or negative. What would happen if $m = n$? In this case, we would use the zero exponent rule of exponents to simplify the expression to 1. 

If we were to simplify the original expression using the quotient rule, we would have

$\frac{t^8}{t^8}$ = $t^8$ $-$ $t^8$ $= t0$

If we equate the two answers, the result is $t^0$ $= 1$. This is true for any nonzero real number, or any variable representing a real number.

$a^0$ $= 1$

### Using the Negative Rule of Exponents
Another useful result occurs if we relax the condition that $m > n$ in the quotient rule even further. 

When m < n — that is, where the difference m − n is negative — we can use the negative rule of exponents to simplify the expression to its reciprocal.

Putting the answers together, we have
$h^{-2}$ $=$ $\frac{1}{h^2}$

This is true for any nonzero real number, or any variable representing
a nonzero real number

A factor with a negative exponent becomes the same factor with a positive exponent if it is moved across the fraction bar—from numerator to denominator or vice versa.

$a^{-n}$ $=$ $\frac{1}{a^n}$

### Finding the Power of a Product
To simplify the power of a product of two exponential expressions, we can use the **power of a product rule of exponents**, which breaks up the power of a product of factors into the product of the powers of the factors. 

For any nonzero real number a and natural number n, the negative rule of exponents states that

$(ab)^n$ $=$ $a^n$ $b^n$

### Finding the Power of a Quotient
To simplify the power of a quotient of two expressions, we can use the power of a quotient rule, which states that the power of a quotient of factors is the quotient of the powers of the factors. 

For any real numbers a and b and any integer n, the power of a quotient rule of exponents states that

$(\frac{a}{b})^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$

### Simplifying Exponential Expressions
Recall that to simplify an expression means to rewrite it by combing terms or exponents; in other words, to write the expression more simply with fewer terms. The rules for exponents may be combined to simplify expressions.

# Section 1.3: Radicals and Rational Expressions

>Learning Objectives
>
>In this section, you will:
>+	 Evaluate square roots.
>+	 Use the product rule to simplify square roots.
>+	 Use the quotient rule to simplify square roots.

>+	 Rationalize denominators.

## Evaluating Square Roots
When the square root of a number is squared, the result is the original number. Since $4^2$ = 16, the square root of 16 is 4. The square root function is the inverse of the squaring function just as subtraction is the inverse of addition. To undo squaring, we take the square root. 

 The **principal square root** is the nonnegative number that when multiplied by itself equals a. The square root obtained using a calculator is the principal square root.

The principal square root of a is written as $\sqrt{a}$. _The symbol is called a_ **radical**, _the term under the symbol is called_
the **radicand**, and _the entire expression is called_ a **radical expression**. 

## Using the Product Rule to Simplify Square Roots
To simplify a square root, we rewrite it such that there are no perfect squares in the radicand. The first rule we will look at is the product rule for simplifying square roots, which allows us to separate the square root of a product of two numbers into the product of two separate rational expressions.

If a and b are nonnegative, the square root of the product ab is equal to the product of the square roots of a and b.

$\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} * \sqrt{b}$

## Using the Quotient Rule to Simplify Square Roots
Just as we can rewrite the square root of a product as a product of square roots, so too can we rewrite the square root of a quotient as a quotient of square roots, using **the quotient rule for simplifying square roots**. It can be helpful to separate the numerator and denominator of a fraction under a radical so that we can take their square roots separately. 

The square root of the quotient $\frac{a}{b}$ is equal to the quotient of the square roots of a and b, where b ≠ 0.

$\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$


## Rationalizing Denominators

When an expression involving square root radicals is written in simplest form, it will not contain a radical in the denominator. We can remove radicals from the denominators of fractions using a process called **rationalizing the denominator**.

We know that multiplying by 1 does not change the value of an expression. We use this property of multiplication to change expressions that contain radicals in the denominator. To remove radicals from the denominators of fractions, multiply by the form of 1 that will eliminate the radical.

For a denominator containing a single term, multiply by the radical in the denominator over itself. In other words, if the denominator is $b\sqrt{c}$, multiply by $\frac{\sqrt{c}}{\sqrt{c}'}$ 

For a denominator containing the sum of a rational and an irrational term, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is found by changing the sign of the radical portion of the denominator. If the denominator is $a + b\sqrt{c}$, then the conjugate is $a - b\sqrt{c}$


## Using Rational Roots

Although square roots are the most common rational roots, we can also find cuberoots, 4th roots, 5th roots, and more. Just as the square root function is the inverse of the squaring function, these roots are the inverse of their respective power functions. These functions can be useful when we need to determine the number that, when raised to a certain power, gives a certain number.

If a is a real number with at least one nth root, then **the principal nth root of a**, written as $\sqrt[n]{a}$, is the number with the same sign as a that, when raised to the nth power, equals a. The **index** of the radical is n.


## Using Rational Exponents
Radical expressions can also be written without using the radical symbol. We can use rational (fractional) exponents. The index must be a positive integer. If the index n is even, then a cannot be negative.

$a^\frac{1}{n} = \sqrt[n]{a}$

We can also have rational exponents with numerators other than 1. In these cases, the exponent must be a fraction in lowest terms. We raise the base to a power and take an nth root. The numerator tells us the power and the denominator tells us the root.

$a^\frac{m}{n} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m = \sqrt[n]{a^m}$

# SECTION 1.4 Polynomials

Learning Objectives
In this section, you will:
>•	 Identify the degree and leading coefficient of polynomials.

>•	 Add and subtract polynomials.

>•	 Multiply polynomials.

>•	 Use FOIL to multiply binomials.

>•	 Perform operations with polynomials of several variables.

## Identifying the Degree and Leading Coefficient of Polynomials
**A polynomial**, *is a sum of or difference of terms, each consisting of a variable raised to a nonnegative integer power*. A number multiplied by a variable raised to an exponent, such as 384π, is known as a **coefficient**. Coefficients can be positive, negative, or zero, and can be whole numbers, decimals, or fractions. Each product $a_ix^i$, such as $384_πw$, is **a term of a polynomial**. If a term does not contain a variable, it is called a _constant_.

A polynomial containing only one term, such as $5x^4$, is called a **monomial**. A polynomial containing two terms, such as $2x − 9$, is called a **binomial**. A polynomial containing three terms, such as $−3x^2 + 8x − 7$, is called a **trinomial**.

> ### Polynomials
>
>A polynomial is an expression that can be written in the form
> $a_nx^n + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$
>
>Each real number $a_i$ is called a **coefficient**.
>The number $a_0$ that is not multiplied by a variable is called a **constant**.
>
>Each product $a_ix^i$ is a **term of a polynomial**. The highest power of the variable that occurs in the polynomial is called the **degree** of a polynomial. The *leading term* is the term with the highest power, and its coefficient is called the leading coefficient.

## Adding and Subtracting Polynomials
We can add and subtract polynomials by combining like terms, which are terms that contain the same variables raised to the same exponents. For example, $5x^2$ and $-2x^2$ are like terms, and can be added to get $3x^2$, but $3x$ and $3x^2$ are not like terms, and therefore cannot be added.

## Multiplying Polynomials
Multiplying polynomials is a bit more challenging than adding and subtracting polynomials. We must use the distributive property to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. We then combine like terms. We can also use a shortcut called the FOIL method when multiplying binomials. Certain special products follow patterns that we can memorize and use instead of multiplying the polynomials by hand each time. We will look at a variety of ways to multiply polynomials.

### Multiplying Polynomials Using the Distributive Property
To multiply a number by a polynomial, we use the distributive property. The number must be distributed to each term of the polynomial. We can distribute the 2 in $2(x + 7)$ to obtain the equivalent expression $2x+14$. When multiplying polynomials, the distributive property allows us to multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second. We then add the products together and combine like terms to simplify.

### Using FOIL to Multiply Binomials
A shortcut called FOIL is sometimes used to find the product of two binomials. It is called FOIL because we multiply the first terms, the outer terms, the inner terms, and then the last terms of each binomial.

The FOIL method arises out of the distributive property. We are simply multiplying each term of the first binomial by each term of the second binomial, and then combining like terms.

>How To…

>Given two binomials, use FOIL to simplify the expression.
>1. Multiply the first terms of each binomial.
>2. Multiply the outer terms of the binomials.
>3. Multiply the inner terms of the binomials.
>4. Multiply the last terms of each binomial.
>5. Add the products.
>6. Combine like terms and simplify.

### Perfect Square Trinomials
Certain binomial products have special forms. When a binomial is squared, the result is called a **perfect square trinomial**. We can find the square by multiplying the binomial by itself. However, there is a special form that each of these perfect square trinomials takes, and memorizing the form makes squaring binomials much easier and faster.
Let’s look at a few perfect square trinomials to familiarize ourselves with the form.

Notice that the first term of each trinomial is the square of the first term of the binomial and, similarly, the last term of each trinomial is the square of the last term of the binomial. The middle term is double the product of the two terms.
Lastly, we see that the first sign of the trinomial is the same as the sign of the binomial.

>**Perfect square trinomials**
>When a binomial is squared, the result is the first term squared added to double the product of both terms and the last term squared.
>
>$(x + a)^2 = (x + a)(x + a) = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$

>How To…
>
>Given a binomial, square it using the formula for perfect square trinomials.
>1. Square the first term of the binomial.
>2. Square the last term of the binomial.
>3. For the middle term of the trinomial, double the product of the two terms.
>4. Add and simplify

### Difference of Squares
Another special product is called the difference of squares, which occurs when we multiply a binomial by another binomial with the same terms but the opposite sign. Let’s see what happens when we multiply $(x + 1)(x − 1)$ using the FOIL method.

$(x + 1)(x − 1) = x^2 − x + x − 1$

$= x^2 − 1$

The middle term drops out, resulting in a difference of squares. Because the sign changes in the second binomial, the outer and inner terms cancel each other out, and we are left only with the square of the first term minus the square of the last term.

>### difference of squares
>When a binomial is multiplied by a binomial with the same terms separated by the opposite sign, the result is the square of the first term minus the square of the last term.

>1. Square the first term of the binomials.
>2. Square the last term of the binomials.
>3. Subtract the square of the last term from the square of the first term.

### Performing Operations with Polynomials of Several Variables
We have looked at polynomials containing only one variable. However, a polynomial can contain several variables. All of the same rules apply when working with polynomials containing several variables. Let's see an example:

>$(a + 2b)(4a − b − c)$
>
>$a(4a − b − c) + 2b(4a − b − c)$ Use the distributive property.
>
>$4a^2 − ab − ac + 8ab − 2b^2 − 2bc$ Multiply.
>
>$4a^2 + ( −ab + 8ab) − ac − 2b^2 − 2bc$ Combine like terms.
>
>$4a^2 + 7ab − ac − 2bc − 2b^2$ Simplify

# SECTION 1.5 Factoring Polynomials

> Learning Objectives
>
>In this section, you will:
>+ Factor the greatest common factor of a polynomial.
>+ Factor a trinomial.
>+ Factor by grouping.
>+ Factor a perfect square trinomial.
>+ Factor a difference of squares.
>+ Factor the sum and difference of cubes.
>+ Factor expressions using fractional or negative exponents.


Many polynomial expressions can be written in simpler forms by factoring. In this section, we will look at a variety of methods that can be used to factor polynomial expressions.

## Factoring the Greatest Common Factor of a Polynomial
When we study fractions, we learn that the **greatest common factor (GCF)** of two numbers is the largest number that divides evenly into both numbers. For instance, 4 is the GCF of 16 and 20 because it is the largest number that divides evenly into both 16 and 20 The GCF of polynomials works the same way: $4x$ is the GCF of $16x$ and $20x^2$ because it is the largest polynomial that divides evenly into both $16x$ and $20x^2$.

When factoring a polynomial expression, our first step should be to check for a GCF. Look for the GCF of the coefficients, and then look for the GCF of the variables.


>How To…
>
>Given a polynomial expression, factor out the greatest common factor.
>1. Identify the GCF of the coefficients.
>2. Identify the GCF of the variables.
>3. Combine to find the GCF of the expression.
>4. Determine what the GCF needs to be multiplied by to obtain each term in the expression.
>5. Write the factored expression as the product of the GCF and the sum of the terms we need to multiply by.

## Factoring a Trinomial with Leading Coefficient 1
Although we should always begin by looking for a GCF, pulling out the GCF is not the only way that polynomial expressions can be factored. The polynomial $x^2 + 5x + 6$ has a GCF of 1, but it can be written as the product of the factors $(x + 2)$ and $(x + 3)$.

Trinomials of the form $x^2 + bx + c$ can be factored by finding two numbers with a product of $c$ and a sum of $b$. The trinomial $x^2 + 10x + 16$, for example, can be factored using the numbers 2 and 8 because the product of those numbers is 16 and their sum is 10. The trinomial can be rewritten as the product of (x + 2) and (x + 8).

> ### factoring a trinomial with leading coefficient 1
>A trinomial of the form $x^2 + bx + c$ can be written in factored form as $(x + p)(x + q)$ where $pq = c$ and $p + q = b$.

>How To…
>
>Given a trinomial in the form $x^2 + bx + c$, factor it.
>1. List factors of c.
>2. Find p and q, a pair of factors of c with a sum of b.
>3. Write the factored expression $(x + p)(x + q)$.


## Factoring by Grouping
Trinomials with leading coefficients other than 1 are slightly more complicated to factor. For these trinomials, we can factor by grouping by dividing the x term into the sum of two terms, factoring each portion of the expression separately, and then factoring out the GCF of the entire expression. 

>### factor by grouping
>To factor a trinomial in the form ax $2 + bx + c$ by grouping, we find two numbers with a product of *ac* and a sum of *b*. We use these numbers to divide the *x* term into the sum of two terms and factor each portion of the expression separately, then factor out the GCF of the entire expression.

>4. Pull out the GCF of $ax^2 + px$.
>5. Pull out the GCF of $qx + c$.
>6. Factor out the GCF of the expression.

### Factoring a Perfect Square Trinomial
A perfect square trinomial is a trinomial that can be written as the square of a binomial. Recall that when a binomial is squared, the result is the square of the first term added to twice the product of the two terms and the square of the last term.

>### Perfect square trinomials
>A perfect square trinomial can be written as the square of a binomial:
>
>$a^2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)^2$


> ### How To…

>1. Confirm that the first and last term are perfect squares.
>2. Confirm that the middle term is twice the product of $ab$.
>3. Write the factored form as $(a + b)^2$.



### Factoring a Difference of Squares
A difference of squares is a perfect square subtracted from a perfect square. Recall that a difference of squares can be rewritten as factors containing the same terms but opposite signs because the middle terms cancel each other out when the two factors are multiplied.

$a2 − b2 = (a + b)(a − b)$

We can use this equation to factor any differences of squares.

### How To…
>
>Given a difference of squares, factor it into binomials.
>1. Confirm that the first and last term are perfect squares.
2>. Write the factored form as $(a + b)(a − b)$.

## Factoring the Sum and Difference of Cubes
Now, we will look at two new special products: the sum and difference of cubes. Although the sum of squares cannot be factored, the sum of cubes can be factored into a binomial and a trinomial.
$a^3 + b^3 = (a + b) (a^2 − ab + b^2)$

Similarly, the sum of cubes can be factored into a binomial and a trinomial, but with different signs.

$a^3 − b^3 = (a − b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$

We can use the acronym **SOAP** to remember the signs when factoring the sum or difference of cubes. The first letter of each word relates to the signs: **S**ame **O**pposite **A**lways **P**ositive. For example, consider the following example.

$x^3 − 2^3 = (x − 2)(x^2 + 2x + 4)$

The sign of the first 2 is the same as the sign between $x^3 − 23$. The sign of the $2x$ term is opposite the sign between $x^3 − 23$. And the sign of the last term, 4, is always positive.


>### sum and difference of cubes
>We can factor the sum of two cubes as
>$a^3 + b^3 = (a + b) (a^2 − ab + b^2)
>
>We can factor the difference of two cubes as

###How To…

## Factoring Expressions with Fractional or Negative Exponents
Expressions with fractional or negative exponents can be factored by pulling out a GCF. Look for the variable or exponent that is common to each term of the expression and pull out that variable or exponent raised to the lowest power. These expressions follow the same factoring rules as those with integer exponents.
For instance, $2x\frac{1}{4}+5x\frac{3}{4}$ can be factored by pulling out $x\frac{1}{4}$ and being rewritten as $x\frac{1}{4}(2+5x\frac{1}{2})$.

# 1.6 Rational Expressions

## Simplifying Rational Expressions
The quotient of two polynomial expressions is called a rational expression. We can apply the properties of fractions to rational expressions, such as simplifying the expressions by canceling common factors from the numerator and the denominator. To do this, we first need to factor both the numerator and denominator. Let’s start with the rational expression shown.

$$\large\frac{x^2+8x+16}{x^2+11x+28}$$

We can factor the numerator and denominator to rewrite the expression.

$$\large\frac{(x+4)^2}{(x+4)(x+7)}$$

Then we can simplify that expression by canceling the common factor $(x+ 4)$.

$$\large\frac{x+4}{x+7}$$

## Multiplying Rational Expressions
Multiplication of rational expressions works the same way as multiplication of any other fractions. We multiply the numerators to find the numerator of the product, and then multiply the denominators to find the denominator of the product. Before multiplying, it is helpful to factor the numerators and denominators just as we did when simplifying rational expressions. We are often able to simplify the product of rational expressions.

## Dividing Rational Expressions
Division of rational expressions works the same way as division of other fractions. To divide a rational expression by another rational expression, multiply the first expression by the reciprocal of the second. Using this approach, we would rewrite $\frac{1}{x} \div \frac{x^2}{3}$ as the product $\frac{1}{x} \times \frac{3}{x^2}$. Once the division expression has been rewritten as a multiplication expression, we can multiply as we did before.
$\large\frac{1}{x} \times \frac{3}{x^2}=\frac{3}{x^3}$

>3. Multiply the numerators.
>4. Multiply the denominators.
>5. Simplify.


## Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions
Adding and subtracting rational expressions works just like adding and subtracting numerical fractions. To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. Let’s look at an example of fraction addition.

$\large\frac{5}{24}+\frac{1}{40}=\frac{25}{120}+\frac{3}{20}$

$\large=\frac{28}{120}$

$\large=\frac{7}{30}$

We have to rewrite the fractions so they share a common denominator before we are able to add. We must do the same thing when adding or subtracting rational expressions.

The easiest common denominator to use will be the **least common denominator, or LCD**. The LCD is the smallest multiple that the denominators have in common. To find the LCD of two rational expressions, we factor the expressions and multiply all of the distinct factors. For instance, if the factored denominators were $(x + 3)(x + 4)$ and $(x + 4)(x + 5)$, then the LCD would be $(x + 3)(x + 4)(x + 5)$.

Once we find the LCD, we need to multiply each expression by the form of 1 that will change the denominator to the LCD.

## Simplifying Complex Rational Expressions
A complex rational expression is a rational expression that contains additional rational expressions in the numerator, the denominator, or both. We can simplify complex rational expressions by rewriting the numerator and denominator as single rational expressions and dividing. The complex rational expression $\frac{a}{\frac{1}{b}+c}$ can be simplified by rewriting the numerator as the fraction $\frac{a}{1}$ and combining the expressions in the denominator as $\frac{1+bc}{b}$. We can then rewrite the expression as a multiplication problem using the reciprocal of the denominator. We get $\frac{a}{1}*\frac{b}{1+bc}$, which is equal to $\frac{ab}{1+bc}$.
