## Section 1.1 - REAL NUMBERS: ALGEBRA ESSENTIALS

### Classifying a Real Number

The *numbers we use for counting, or enumerating items*, are the **natural numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

The set of **whole numbers** is the *set of natural numbers plus zero*: {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.

The set of **integers** adds the *opposites of the natural numbers to the set of whole numbers*: {. . ., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.
    It is useful to note that the set of integers is made up of three distinct subsets: negative integers, zero, and positive integers.

The set of **rational numbers** is written as  $\Bigg\{$ $\frac{m}{n}$$\lvert$$m$ and $n$  are integers and $n$ ≠ 0 $\Bigg\}$

    Rational numbers are fractions (or quotients) containing integers in both the numerator and the denominator, and the denominator is never 0.
    We can also see that every natural number, whole number, and integer is a rational number with a denominator of 1.

Because they are fractions, any rational number can also be expressed in decimal form.

    Any rational number can be represented as either:
1. a terminating decimal: $\frac{15}{8}$ = 1.875, or
2. a repeating decimal: $\frac{4}{11}$ = 0.36363636 … = 0.$\overline{36}$

## Irrational Numbers

 **Irrational numbers** *cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers*. It is impossible to describe this set of numbers by a single rule except to say that a number is irrational if it is not rational. So we write this as shown.

{h| h is not a rational number $\mathbb{R}$}


The ***sets of rational* and *irrational numbers* together** make up the **set of real numbers**.

The real numbers can be visualized on a horizontal number line with an arbitrary point chosen as 0, with negative numbers to the left of 0 and positive numbers to the right of 0.

### Sets of Numbers as Subsets
Beginning with the natural numbers, we have expanded each set to form a larger set, meaning that there is a subset relationship between the sets of numbers we have encountered so far.

### sets of numbers
The **set of natural numbers** includes the *numbers used for counting*: {1, 2, 3, ...}.

The **set of whole numbers** is the *set of natural numbers plus zero*: {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

The **set of integers** *adds the negative natural numbers to the set of whole numbers*: {..., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }.

The **set of rational numbers** includes *fractions written as* $\Big\{$ $\frac{m}{n}$$\lvert$$m$ and $n$  are integers and $n$ ≠ 0 $\Big\}$

The **set of irrational numbers** is the *set of numbers that are not rational, are nonrepeating, and are nonterminating*:

{h|h is not a rational number}.


## Performing Calculations Using the Order of Operations

$a^n  = a * a * a * a * ...$

In this notation, $a^n$  is read as the nth power of a, where **a** is called **the base** and **n** is called the **exponent**. 

A term in exponential notation may be part of a mathematical expression, which is a combination of numbers and operations.
For example, 24+6∙$\frac{2}{3}$-42 is a mathematical expression.

To evaluate a mathematical expression, we perform the various operations. We use **the order of operations**. This is a sequence of rules for evaluating such expressions.

> ## order of operations
> Operations in mathematical expressions must be evaluated in a systematic order, which can be simplified using the acronym PEMDAS:
>
> P(arentheses)
>
> E(xponents)
>
> M(ultiplication) and D(ivision)
>
> A(ddition) and S(ubtraction)

## Using Properties of Real Numbers

### Commutative Properties
The **commutative property of addition** states that numbers may be added in any order without affecting the sum.

$a + b = b + a$

Similarly, the **commutative property of multiplication** states that numbers may be multiplied in any order without
affecting the product.

$a * b = b * a$

It is important to note that neither subtraction nor division is commutative. For example, 17 − 5 is not the same as 5 − 17. Similarly, 20 ÷ 5 ≠ 5 ÷ 20.


### Associative Properties
The **associative property of multiplication** tells us that it does not matter how we group numbers when multiplying. We can move the grouping symbols to make the calculation easier, and the product remains the same.

$a(bc) = (ab)c$

The **associative property of addition** tells us that numbers may be grouped differently without affecting the sum.

$a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$

*Neither subtraction nor division is associative*.


### Distributive Property
The **distributive property** states that the product of a factor times a sum is the sum of the factor times each term in the sum.

$a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c$

### Identity Properties
The **identity property of addition** states that there is a unique number, called the additive identity (0) that, when added to a number, results in the original number.

$a + 0 = a$


The **identity property of multiplication** states that there is a unique number, called the multiplicative identity (1) that, when multiplied by a number, results in the original number.

$a * 1 = a$


### Inverse Properties
The **inverse property of addition** states that, for every real number $a$, there is a unique number, called the additive inverse (or opposite), denoted $−a$, that, when added to the original number, results in the additive identity, 0.
a + (−a) = 0

The **inverse property of multiplication** holds for all real numbers except 0 because the reciprocal of 0 is not defined.
The property states that, for every real number a, there is a unique number, called the multiplicative inverse (or reciprocal), denoted $\frac{1}{a}$, that, when multiplied by the original number, results in the multiplicative identity, $a*$ $\frac{1}{a}$=1


## Evaluating Algebraic Expressions

In the expression $x + 5$, **$5$ is called a constant** because it does not vary and **$x$ is called a variable** because it does. (In naming the variable, ignore any exponents or radicals containing the variable).
An *algebraic expression* is a *collection of constants and variables joined together by the algebraic operations* of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Any variable in an algebraic expression may take on or be assigned different values. When that happens, the value of the algebraic expression changes. To evaluate an algebraic expression means to determine the value of the expression for a given value of each variable in the expression.

Replace each variable in the expression with the given value, then simplify the resulting expression using the order of operations. If the algebraic expression contains more than one variable, replace each variable with its assigned value and simplify the expression as before.

## Formulas
An **equation** is a mathematical statement indicating that two expressions are equal. The expressions can be numerical or algebraic. The equation is not inherently true or false, but only a proposition. The values that make the equation true, the solutions, are found using the properties of real numbers and other results. For example, the equation 2x + 1 = 7 has the unique solution x = 3 because when we substitute 3 for x in the equation, we obtain the true statement 2(3) + 1 = 7.

A **formula** is an equation expressing a relationship between constant and variable quantities. Very often, the equation is a means of finding the value of one quantity (often a single variable) in terms of another or other quantities. One of the most common examples is the formula for finding the area A of a circle in terms of the radius r of the circle:
$A = πr^2$. For any value of r, the area A can be found by evaluating the expression $πr^2$.

### Simplifying Algebraic Expressions
Sometimes we can simplify an algebraic expression to make it easier to evaluate or to use in some other way. To do so, *we use the properties of real numbers*. We can use the same properties in formulas because they contain algebraic expressions.

## Section 1.2 - Exponents and Scientific Notation

Learning Objectives
In this section students will:

•    Use the product rule of exponents.

•	 Use the quotient rule of exponents.

•	 Use the power rule of exponents.

•	 Use the zero exponent rule of exponents.

•	 Use the negative rule of exponents.

•	 Find the power of a product and a quotient.

•	 Simplify exponential expressions

•	 Use scientific notation.

### Using the Product Rule of Exponents
Consider the product $x^3$ * $x^4$.Both terms have the same base, x, but they are raised to different exponents. Expand each expression, and then rewrite the resulting expression.

$x^3$ * $x^4$ $= x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x$ = $x^7$

Notice that the exponent of the product is the sum of the exponents of the terms. In other words, when multiplying exponential expressions with the same base, we write the result with the common base and add the exponents. This is the **product rule of exponents**.


$a^m$ $*$ $a^n$ $=$ $a^{m+n}$

We can always check that this is true by simplifying each exponential expression. We find that $2^3$ is 8, $2^4$ is 16, and $2^7$ is 128. The product $8*16$ equals 128, so the relationship is true. We can use the product rule of exponents to simplify expressions that are a product of two numbers or expressions with the same base but different exponents.


### Using the Quotient Rule of Exponents
The quotient rule of exponents allows us to simplify an expression that divides two numbers with the same base but different exponents. In a similar way to the product rule, we can simplify an expression such as $\frac{y^m}{y^n}$, where m > n. 

Notice that the exponent of the quotient is the difference between the exponents of the divisor and dividend.

$\frac{a^m}{a^n}$ $=a^{m − n}$

### Using the Power Rule of Exponents

Suppose an exponential expression is raised to some power. Can we simplify the result? Yes. To do this, we use the power rule of exponents. Consider the expression (${x^2})^3$. The expression inside the parentheses is multiplied twice because it has an exponent of 2. Then the result is multiplied three times because the entire expression has an exponent of 3.

The exponent of the answer is the product of the exponents: (${x^2})^3$ $=$ $x^{2*3}$ = $x^6$. In other words, when raising an exponential expression to a power, we write the result with the common base and the product of the exponents.

($a^m$)$^n$ $=$ $a^{m * n}$

### Using the Zero Exponent Rule of Exponents
Return to the quotient rule. We made the condition that $m > n$ so that the difference m − n would never be zero or negative. What would happen if $m = n$? In this case, we would use the zero exponent rule of exponents to simplify the expression to 1. 

If we were to simplify the original expression using the quotient rule, we would have

$\frac{t^8}{t^8}$ = $t^8$ $-$ $t^8$ $= t0$

If we equate the two answers, the result is $t^0$ $= 1$. This is true for any nonzero real number, or any variable representing a real number.

$a^0$ $= 1$

### Using the Negative Rule of Exponents
Another useful result occurs if we relax the condition that $m > n$ in the quotient rule even further. 

When m < n — that is, where the difference m − n is negative — we can use the negative rule of exponents to simplify the expression to its reciprocal.

Putting the answers together, we have
$h^{-2}$ $=$ $\frac{1}{h^2}$

This is true for any nonzero real number, or any variable representing
a nonzero real number

A factor with a negative exponent becomes the same factor with a positive exponent if it is moved across the fraction bar—from numerator to denominator or vice versa.

$a^{-n}$ $=$ $\frac{1}{a^n}$

### Finding the Power of a Product
To simplify the power of a product of two exponential expressions, we can use the **power of a product rule of exponents**, which breaks up the power of a product of factors into the product of the powers of the factors. 

For any nonzero real number a and natural number n, the negative rule of exponents states that

$(ab)^n$ $=$ $a^n$ $b^n$

### Finding the Power of a Quotient
To simplify the power of a quotient of two expressions, we can use the power of a quotient rule, which states that the power of a quotient of factors is the quotient of the powers of the factors. 

For any real numbers a and b and any integer n, the power of a quotient rule of exponents states that

$(\frac{a}{b})^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$

### Simplifying Exponential Expressions
Recall that to simplify an expression means to rewrite it by combing terms or exponents; in other words, to write the expression more simply with fewer terms. The rules for exponents may be combined to simplify expressions.

## Evaluating Square Roots
When the square root of a number is squared, the result is the original number. Since $4^2$ = 16, the square root of 16 is 4. The square root function is the inverse of the squaring function just as subtraction is the inverse of addition. To undo squaring, we take the square root. 

 The **principal square root** is the nonnegative number that when multiplied by itself equals a. The square root obtained using a calculator is the principal square root.

The principal square root of a is written as $\sqrt{a}$. _The symbol is called a_ **radical**, _the term under the symbol is called_
the **radicand**, and _the entire expression is called_ a **radical expression**. 

## Using the Product Rule to Simplify Square Roots
To simplify a square root, we rewrite it such that there are no perfect squares in the radicand. The first rule we will look at is the product rule for simplifying square roots, which allows us to separate the square root of a product of two numbers into the product of two separate rational expressions.

If a and b are nonnegative, the square root of the product ab is equal to the product of the square roots of a and b.

$\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} * \sqrt{b}$

## Using the Quotient Rule to Simplify Square Roots
Just as we can rewrite the square root of a product as a product of square roots, so too can we rewrite the square root of a quotient as a quotient of square roots, using **the quotient rule for simplifying square roots**. It can be helpful to separate the numerator and denominator of a fraction under a radical so that we can take their square roots separately. 

The square root of the quotient $\frac{a}{b}$ is equal to the quotient of the square roots of a and b, where b ≠ 0.

$\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$


## Rationalizing Denominators

When an expression involving square root radicals is written in simplest form, it will not contain a radical in the denominator. We can remove radicals from the denominators of fractions using a process called **rationalizing the denominator**.

We know that multiplying by 1 does not change the value of an expression. We use this property of multiplication to change expressions that contain radicals in the denominator. To remove radicals from the denominators of fractions, multiply by the form of 1 that will eliminate the radical.

For a denominator containing a single term, multiply by the radical in the denominator over itself. In other words, if the denominator is $b\sqrt{c}$, multiply by $\frac{\sqrt{c}}{\sqrt{c}'}$ 

For a denominator containing the sum of a rational and an irrational term, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is found by changing the sign of the radical portion of the denominator. If the denominator is $a + b\sqrt{c}$, then the conjugate is $a - b\sqrt{c}$


## Using Rational Roots

Although square roots are the most common rational roots, we can also find cuberoots, 4th roots, 5th roots, and more. Just as the square root function is the inverse of the squaring function, these roots are the inverse of their respective power functions. These functions can be useful when we need to determine the number that, when raised to a certain power, gives a certain number.

If a is a real number with at least one nth root, then **the principal nth root of a**, written as $\sqrt[n]{a}$, is the number with the same sign as a that, when raised to the nth power, equals a. The **index** of the radical is n.


## Using Rational Exponents
Radical expressions can also be written without using the radical symbol. We can use rational (fractional) exponents. The index must be a positive integer. If the index n is even, then a cannot be negative.

$a^\frac{1}{n} = \sqrt[n]{a}$

We can also have rational exponents with numerators other than 1. In these cases, the exponent must be a fraction in lowest terms. We raise the base to a power and take an nth root. The numerator tells us the power and the denominator tells us the root.

$a^\frac{m}{n} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m = \sqrt[n]{a^m}$


# SECTION 1.4 Polynomials

Learning Objectives
In this section, you will:
>•	 Identify the degree and leading coefficient of polynomials.

>•	 Add and subtract polynomials.

>•	 Multiply polynomials.

>•	 Use FOIL to multiply binomials.

>•	 Perform operations with polynomials of several variables.

## Identifying the Degree and Leading Coefficient of Polynomials
**A polynomial**, *is a sum of or difference of terms, each consisting of a variable raised to a nonnegative integer power*. A number multiplied by a variable raised to an exponent, such as 384π, is known as a **coefficient**. Coefficients can be positive, negative, or zero, and can be whole numbers, decimals, or fractions. Each product $a_ix^i$, such as $384_πw$, is **a term of a polynomial**. If a term does not contain a variable, it is called a _constant_.

A polynomial containing only one term, such as $5x^4$, is called a **monomial**. A polynomial containing two terms, such as $2x − 9$, is called a **binomial**. A polynomial containing three terms, such as $−3x^2 + 8x − 7$, is called a **trinomial**.

> ### Polynomials
>
>A polynomial is an expression that can be written in the form
> $a_nx^n + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$
>
>Each real number $a_i$ is called a **coefficient**.
>The number $a_0$ that is not multiplied by a variable is called a **constant**.
>
>Each product $a_ix^i$ is a **term of a polynomial**. The highest power of the variable that occurs in the polynomial is called the **degree** of a polynomial. The *leading term* is the term with the highest power, and its coefficient is called the leading coefficient.

## Adding and Subtracting Polynomials
We can add and subtract polynomials by combining like terms, which are terms that contain the same variables raised to the same exponents. For example, $5x^2$ and $-2x^2$ are like terms, and can be added to get $3x^2$, but $3x$ and $3x^2$ are not like terms, and therefore cannot be added.

## Multiplying Polynomials
Multiplying polynomials is a bit more challenging than adding and subtracting polynomials. We must use the distributive property to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. We then combine like terms. We can also use a shortcut called the FOIL method when multiplying binomials. Certain special products follow patterns that we can memorize and use instead of multiplying the polynomials by hand each time. We will look at a variety of ways to multiply polynomials.

### Multiplying Polynomials Using the Distributive Property
To multiply a number by a polynomial, we use the distributive property. The number must be distributed to each term of the polynomial. We can distribute the 2 in $2(x + 7)$ to obtain the equivalent expression $2x+14$. When multiplying polynomials, the distributive property allows us to multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second. We then add the products together and combine like terms to simplify.

### Using FOIL to Multiply Binomials
A shortcut called FOIL is sometimes used to find the product of two binomials. It is called FOIL because we multiply the first terms, the outer terms, the inner terms, and then the last terms of each binomial.

The FOIL method arises out of the distributive property. We are simply multiplying each term of the first binomial by each term of the second binomial, and then combining like terms.

>How To…
>
>Given two binomials, use FOIL to simplify the expression.
>1. Multiply the first terms of each binomial.
>2. Multiply the outer terms of the binomials.
>3. Multiply the inner terms of the binomials.
>4. Multiply the last terms of each binomial.
>5. Add the products.
>6. Combine like terms and simplify.

### Perfect Square Trinomials
Certain binomial products have special forms. When a binomial is squared, the result is called a **perfect square trinomial**. We can find the square by multiplying the binomial by itself. However, there is a special form that each of these perfect square trinomials takes, and memorizing the form makes squaring binomials much easier and faster.
Let’s look at a few perfect square trinomials to familiarize ourselves with the form.
